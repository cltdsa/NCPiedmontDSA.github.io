NC Piedmont DSA is the regional chapter for members of the [Democratic Socialists of America](http://www.dsausa.org/) (DSA) in and around Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Hillsborough, Carrboro, Chapel Hill, Durham, & Raleigh.

The largest socialist organization in the United States, DSA is an activist organization, not a political party. Through the work of our members in local chapters and on a national level, DSA is at the center of the struggle for progress, justice, & democracy. We fight for an economy based on social needs & democratic values, not unchecked greed & unaccountable power; against oppression based on class, race, gender, sexuality, nationality, & other forms of injustice; for a clean environment & a livable world; against militarism at home and abroad. We pursue meaningful advances on all of these issues while building a long-term movement for social and economic change.

> DSA is the major organization on the American left with an all-embracing moral vision, systematic social analysis, and political praxis rooted in the quest for radical democracy, social freedom, and individual liberties.

> DSA carries on a fine old American tradition— the tradition carried on by Eugene Debs, Mother Jones, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and thousands more. I am proud to be a member.

--Barbara Ehrenreich, DSA Honorary Chair
